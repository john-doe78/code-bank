# DSA Interview Revision Plan

This 4-week revision plan is designed to consolidate your Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) knowledge for an upcoming interview. It assumes prior DSA exposure and 1-2 hours of daily study. The plan focuses on revisiting key topics, practicing problems, and simulating interview conditions.

## General Guidelines
- **Platforms**: Use LeetCode, HackerRank, or AlgoExpert for problems.
- **Tracking**: Log problems solved, mistakes, and key takeaways in a notebook or spreadsheet.
- **Mock Interviews**: Schedule 1-2 mock interviews in Weeks 3 and 4 (e.g., on Pramp or Interviewing.io).
- **Resources**: Refer to "Cracking the Coding Interview" (CTCI), GeeksforGeeks, or YouTube tutorials for quick refreshers.
- **Focus Areas**: Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Hashing, Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming (DP), Greedy Algorithms, Bit Manipulation.
