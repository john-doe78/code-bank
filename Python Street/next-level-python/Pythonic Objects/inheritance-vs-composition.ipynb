    "## Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "- Advantages\n",
    "    - Easy to code reuse\n",
    "    - Allow changing inherited implementation\n",
    "- Disadvantages\n",
    "    - It supports weak encapsulation & fragile structure\n",
    "    - Relationship between base & derived classes are statically fixed\n",
    "    - Derived class inherits everything from base class, even things it doesn't need\n",
    "    - Changes in a base class interface impact all derived classes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Composition\n",
    "\n",
    "- Advantages\n",
    "    - Supports Good encapsulation & adaptable structure\n",
    "    - Configuarable at runtime\n",
    "    - Interface changes have limited ripple effect\n",
    "- Disadvantages\n",
    "    - Sometimes hard to read code than inheritance\n",
    "    - More code to write than inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to use Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "- when derived class & base class are in the same module/package & under the control of same programmers.\n",
    "- when extending classes are specially designed & documented for extension "
