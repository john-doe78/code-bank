    "### JavaScript Version\n",
    "\n",
    "> **NOTE**: JavaScript is not Versioned\n",
    "\n",
    "Deprecated syntax for JS Versioning. It was available for Mozilla (netscape and firefox) only, from 1996 to 2010\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "From\n",
    "<script language=\"JavaScript1.1\"></script>\n",
    "\n",
    "To\n",
    "<script language=\"JavaScript1.8.5\"></script>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Brief History of JavaScript\n",
    "\n",
    "* 1995: Brendan Eich created JavaScript.\n",
    "* 1996: NetsCape 2 added JS 1.0\n",
    "* 1996: IE 3 added support for JScript\n",
    "* 1997: JS 1.0 became an ECMA Standard, known as ECMA-Script (ES)\n",
    "* 1997: IE 4 supported ES1\n",
    "* 1999: ES3 was released\n",
    "* 2000 - 2009: The dark ages for JavaScript\n",
    "* 2009: ES5 was released\n",
    "* 2015: A new ES process started with ES6\n",
    "\n",
    "### ECMAScript\n",
    "\n",
    "* It's a standard for scripting languages\n",
    "* TC-39 is its technical committee\n",
    "* JavaScript used by browsers or Node are ECMAScript engines\n",
    "* Other engines: ActionScript, JScript.NET\n",
    "* Since ES2015 (or ES6) we have one version published per year\n",
    "* As developers, we can't specify which version we want to use, it's up to the engine where the script is executed\n",
    "\n",
    "> If you use syntax of an ES version that is not supported on the enginee running it you may get a syntax error or runtime exeception. \n",
    "\n",
    "To know which ECMAScript version that your enginee uses:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Node: Check [node.green](https://node.green/)\n",
    "* Browsers: Check [caniuse.com/ecampscript](https://caniuse.com/?search=ecampscript)\n",
    "\n",
    "### TC39 Process\n",
    "\n",
    "Every proposal goes through a process\n",
    "\n",
    "* Stage-0: Strawperson\n",
    "* Stage-1: Under Consideration\n",
    "* Stage-2: Draft\n",
    "* Stage-2.7: Approved\n",
    "* Stage-3: Candidate\n",
    "* Stage-4: Complete, ready for ES-next\n",
    "\n",
    "Backward compatibility is forced\n",
    "\n",
    "* Most changes are sugar syntax from the previous version\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modern Versions of ECMAScript\n",
    "\n",
    "* From ES1 to ES5 versions were using numbers\n",
    "* From ES6, also known as ES2015, the year of release is also used as version. \n",
    "* From ES6 TC-39 has an annual version process so there will be an ES version for every year since 2015.\n",
    "* While ES14 do exist as a version number, the community uses the year version from ES7, so it's ES2023.\n",
    "\n",
    "> When we talk about ECMAScript, We are not talking about platform APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most platform APIs are defined by W3C, OpenJS Foundation, and Other organizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **NOTE**: ECMA Internationalization API under the ECMA-402 is a separate ECMAScript-related spec separated from the core spec.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use modern ES Syntax on older engines\n",
    "\n",
    "* Polyfiles\n",
    "* Transpilers\n",
    "\n",
    "### ES Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "Standardized way to organize and resuse JavaScript code across different files using import and export statements for better modularity and maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ES6 included modules\n",
    "* They work as a container isolated from the global object.\n",
    "* For node: it's living together with commonJs modules using `require()`\n",
    "* Each modules works in a separate file\n",
    "    * For browser `.js`\n",
    "    * For node, `.mjs`\n",
    "* The global scope creates a module import tree as soon as it's parsing modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modules in Window Context\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<script src=\"\" type=\"modules\"></script>\n",

    "#### Modules in Node\n",
