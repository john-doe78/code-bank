### Web Service Types

* **RESTful**: Uses HTTP as the access protocol
* **SOAP**: Uses XML to send messages.

### Advantages

* Reusability
* Language Transparency
* Usability
* Deployability

**Latency**: The time it takes for a request to receive a response.

**Partial Failure**: Occurs when a server or network fails to respond.

### API Security

* **Authentication**: Validates the identity of the client.
* **Authorization**: Determines the level of the client's access.
* **API Authentication**: Requires an API key or basic authentication to access the API.

**REST API** is a set of guidelines to design an API. It is lightweight compared to SOAP.

### REST API Guidelines

* URI: Uniform Resource Identifier
* Operations
    * GET: Retrieves a resource
    * PUT: Updates a resource
    * POST: Creates a resource
    * DELETE: Remove a resource
* Formats
    * HTML
    * XML
    * Plain Text
* Stateless: Don't remember previous client request

**Payload**: Data sent between client and server

**HATEOAS**: Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State

**GraphQL**: A query language for APIs that allows clients to request only the data they need.

**HTTP** stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It's a protocol used for transferring hypertext.

### HTTP Principles

* Language and Human-Readable
    * Methods: GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, PATCH, HEAD, CONNECT, etc.
* Stateless Protocol
    * Does not remember previous requests
* Stateless but not sessionless
* Works based on pairs of requests and responses

### HTTP Terminologies

* **Browser:** Application used to access and navigate HTML documents.
* **User-agent:** Application acting on behalf of the user (e.g., a browser).
* **TCP:** Transmission Control Protocol, one of the main protocols used by WWW, FTP Server, and Email.
* **IP:** Internet Protocol. IP is used to transfer data between computers over a network.
* **URL:** Uniform Resource Locator. An address pointing at a resource on the web.
* **DNS:** Domain name server, DNS Catalogs all domain name URLs and points them to the IP addresses of the servers.
* **Resource:** The file or files available on a server when following a URL.
* **Server:** Computer on the Internet.
* **Proxy:** Acting as middleware between clients and servers.
* **Request-response pairs:** Client and server communicate over HTTP using request-response pairs.
* **Header:** Request and response use HTTP headers to pass information back and forth
* **HTTP Methods:** GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
* **Cache:** Method for storing data on the client/server to speed up performance.
* **Cookie:** String of data passed back and forth between client and server to create a state full session.
* **Session:** Clients and servers can share information about states by passing a session.
