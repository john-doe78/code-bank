# DSA Interview Preparation Plan

This is a 4-week plan to prepare for a Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) interview. It includes a weekly breakdown, daily routines, and suggested problems to practice. The plan assumes 2-4 hours of daily study and practice, balancing theory, problem-solving, and revision.

## General Guidelines
- **Platforms**: Use LeetCode, HackerRank, or AlgoExpert for problems. Create a free account if needed.
- **Tracking**: Maintain a notebook or spreadsheet to track problems solved, mistakes, and key takeaways.
- **Mock Interviews**: Schedule 1-2 mock interviews (e.g., on Pramp or Interviewing.io) in Weeks 3 and 4.
- **Resources**: Refer to "Cracking the Coding Interview" (CTCI) or online tutorials (e.g., GeeksforGeeks, YouTube) for theory.
- **Focus Areas**: Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Hashing, Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, and Bit Manipulation.

- **Understand Patterns**: Focus on recognizing patterns (e.g., two-pointer, sliding window, backtracking).
- **Explain Your Thought Process**: Practice verbalizing your approach while solving problems.
- **Stay Consistent**: Stick to the daily routine and avoid burnout by taking short breaks.
- **Review Mistakes**: Revisit incorrect solutions to understand errors and optimize code.

Good luck with your interview preparation!
