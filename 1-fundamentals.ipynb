    "# Sessions 1-2ï½œ4 Pillars of Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "An object is an instance of a class, representing a real-world entity. Objects have:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Properties (data/fields)\n",
    "* Behaviors (methods)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "* Hides the internal implementation details and exposes only essential functionality.\n",
    "* Achieved through abstract classes, interfaces, and access modifiers.\n",
    "* Examples:\n",
    "  * **Cellphone**: User interacts with the \"Call\" button but doesn't need to know about complex network protocols.\n",
    "  * **Car**: Driver uses the brake without understanding the hydraulic system beneath it.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "* Simplifies user interaction with complex systems.\n",
    "* Enhances security by hiding internal details.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Bundles the data and methods that operate on that data into a single unit. It also controls the access to the data to ensure its integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### To achieve Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "* Declare instance variables as `private`.\n",
    "* Provide `public` getter and setter methods to access or modify data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "* Protects the internal state of the object from unwanted changes.\n",
    "* Enhances maintainability and readability by controlling access to data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "* It allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class.\n",
    "* It can be achieved using the `extends` keyword for classes or by implementing interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "* Single Inheritance\n",
    "  * A child class derives properties and behaviors from a single parent class.\n",
    "* Multilevel Inheritance\n",
    "  * A class inherits from a base class, and then another class inherits from that derived class, forming a chain of inheritance.\n",
    "* Hierarchical Inheritance\n",
    "  * Multiple subclasses inherit from a single superclass.\n",
    "* Multiple Inheritance\n",
    "  * When a class extends more than one superclass, it's known as multiple inheritance.\n",
    "  * It is not supported directly in Java.\n",
    "  * Instead, it utilizes interfaces as a mechanism to achieve similar behavior and to overcome theÂ [diamond problem](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/JavaAndDS/abstractInterface/05diamond.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "* Promotes code reusability.\n",
    "* Enables polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "* Polymorphism means \"many forms\".\n",
    "* It allows a method to behave differently based on the context.\n",
    "* Examples:\n",
    "  * A person can be a father, husband, employee, and brother.\n",
    "  * A `Shape` class has a `draw()` method, but `Circle` draws a circle and `Rectangle` draws a rectangle.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "* Compile-Time (Static) Polymorphism / Method Overloading\n",
    "  * Methods with the same name but different parameter lists (including differences in the number, type, or order of parameters) are considered overloaded. The method signature (name + parameter list) determines overloading. The return type and access modifiers do not affect method overloading.\n",
    "* Run-Time (Dynamic) Polymorphism / Method Overriding\n",
    "  * A method in a child class overrides the implementation of a method in its parent class.\n",
    "* Operator overloading is not supported in Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Object Relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "* Is-a Relationship\n",
    "  * Achieved through inheritance, where a subclass is a type of its superclass.\n",
    "  * Example: AÂ `Dog`Â is anÂ `Animal`.\n",
    "* Has-a Relationship\n",
    "  * When a class contains or uses another class, often through an instance variable or reference.\n",
    "  * It is achieved via composition or aggregation.\n",
    "  * These relationships can be one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many.\n",
    "  * Examples:\n",
    "    * AÂ `School`Â hasÂ `Students`.\n",
    "    * AÂ `Bike`Â has anÂ `Engine`.\n",
    "  * Association: A general relationship between two distinct objects.\n",
    "    * **Aggregation**: Both objects can exist independently. The lifecycle of the owned object does not depend on the lifecycle of the owner.\n",
    "      * A `Library` has `Books`, and theÂ `Books`Â can exist outside of theÂ `Library`.\n",
    "    * **Composition**: The owned objectâ€™s lifecycle is dependent on the owner. If the owner is destroyed, the owned object is also destroyed because they cannot exist independently.\n",
    "      * a `House` has `Rooms`, and if the `House` is destroyed, its `Rooms` are also destroyed."
