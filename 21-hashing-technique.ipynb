    "## Why Hashing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hashing is useful for efficient searching operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main methods of searching:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Linear Search: ${O(n)}$\n",
    "* Binary Search: ${O(log n)}$\n",
    "  * Binary search requires the elements to be sorted first, which takes extra effort (typically $O(n \\log n)$ for sorting).\n",
    "* Hashing: ${O(1)}$\n",
    "  * It is the fastest method for searching, but it requires a large amount of space because the size of the hash table often depends on the range or maximum value of the input keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Relational Mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four relational mappings used in hashing:\n",
    "\n",
    "* One to One (ideal hash)\n",
    "* Many to One\n",
    "* One to Many (common in modulo hashing)\n",
    "* Many to Many\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ideal Hash Function\n",
    "\n",
    "An ideal hash function is defined as: ${h(x) = x}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that each key maps directly to an index equal to its value.  \n",
    "For example: $h(3)$ would point to index $3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "![ideal-hash-in-mapping](https://i.ibb.co/jbWb4wk/image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In an ideal hash, we don't store the element directly. Instead, we compute the index using the hash function and store the value at that index.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Drawback\n",
    "\n",
    "An ideal hash function requires a large amount of memory space. If the keys range from $0$ to a very large number, you need that many slots in the table — even if most are empty. To reduce space usage, we can modify the hash function using the modulo operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Collision\n",
    "\n",
    "A more practical hash function is: ${h(x) = x \\% 10}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This reduces the size of the hash table but introduces the possibility of collisions — when two or more keys map to the same index.\n",
    "\n",
    "![hash-with-collision](https://files.catbox.moe/hih75p.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handle Collisions\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Open Hashing\n",
    "  * Separate Chaining\n",
    "* Closed Hashing (Open Addressing)\n",
    "  * All elements are stored within the hash table itself.\n",
    "  * On collision, we probe for the next available slot.  \n",
    "  * Probing Techniques:\n",
    "    * Linear Probing\n",
    "    * Quadratic Probing\n",
    "    * Double Hashing\n",
    "* [Cuckoo Hashing](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/cuckoo-hashing)\n",
    "\n",
    "In open addressing, if a collision occurs, we find the next free space according to a probing strategy and place the new key there.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chaining\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each index stores a linked list of keys.\n",
    "* No space restriction; can grow dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "![hash-chaining](https://i.ibb.co/BLrGx3R/image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When searching for key $12$, we compute $h(12) = 12 % 10 = 2$ and search in the linked list at index $2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis of Hashing\n",
    "\n",
    "The performance of hashing is often analyzed using the load factor $\\lambda$: $\\frac{n}{m}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $n$ = number of keys inserted\n",
    "* $m$ = number of slots (or buckets) in the hash table\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Number of keys, $n = 100$\n",
    "* Number of indices, $m = 10$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\lambda = \\frac{100}{10} = 10$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Average Case Time Complexity (Using Chaining)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Successful Search\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{Time} = 1 + \\frac{\\lambda}{2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "* `1` for computing the hash function\n",
    "* `λ/2` for average search in the linked list\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unsuccessful Search\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{Time} = 1 + \\lambda$\n",
    "\n",
    "* `1` for computing the hash function\n",
    "* `λ` for checking all elements in the linked list"
